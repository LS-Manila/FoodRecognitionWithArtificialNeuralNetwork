- Optimize Speed in Android

## Agenda (01/19/17)

-Review of Objectives 

1.3.1 General Objective
1.3.1.1 To develop an android application that can identify and provide the calories in food commonly found in the Philippines.

1.3.2	Specific Objectives
1.3.2.1 To achieve at least 93% in the top-5 accuracy and at least 74% in the top-1  accuracy when identifying food.
1.3.2.2 To develop a program using OpenCV that can identify and provide the caloric information of food.
1.3.2.3 To develop a database which stores the user's calorie intake.
1.3.2.4 To ensure that the android application is responsive and easy to use. (survey)


Completed
